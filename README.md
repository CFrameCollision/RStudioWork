# RStudio Work
 RStudio work for my data analysis in sociology class with Dr. Mark Killian.

 Unit 3 houses multiple units since I was just learning the basics of project management. Subsequent units are now housed in their own respective files.

I keep personal notes on how to use R, alongside project information, in a Notion wiki. Eventually I'll upload it once I have a reason to.
